*) Implement "assign" for workflows


*) When adding a workflow, how to refresh the list in html?

Think about:
*) two kind of static props? (input able and non-input able)
*) Wildcards for input, like '*'?
*) Make it possible to group inputs?


*****) Maybe I shozuld look for better layering betwenn the jqTouch(AJAX) and the 
 Ruby part. E.g. writing a feed pareser in Java-Script instead of warpping it in Ruby
