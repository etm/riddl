Prequisites
===========

apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl

Exif Server
==============

Resides in the Exif subdirectory.

Takes a jpeg image like the standard Flickr upload with additional paramaters
Artist, Longitude and Latitude. It then generates an Exif tag for the image and
outputs it in a format suitable as input for Flickr upload.

Flickr Client to Upload Photos
==============================

Resides in the Flickr subdirectory.

Before you can start using the flickr.rb you have to authenticate this
application for a certain user:

Steps: 

1) Run "authenticate.rb" which generates a "flickr.frob" and a url.
2) Open the url in your browser.
3) Allow the client.rb to access your flickr account. Please check flickr.rb to
find out if it does bad things to your account. Of course if you code to it
that does harmful things, this is not our fault :-)

After these steps you are ready to use flickr.rb.
